## Introduction

This is a solo project aiming to build my knowledge in Javascript, SQL, CSS, and HTML. Current goal is to store and reference search data through SQL. 

## Features

Currently in an inoperable state. Styling is the only thing finished. Images displayed containt text underneath that opens the image from the source in a new tab. 'index.html' is currently incomplete.
